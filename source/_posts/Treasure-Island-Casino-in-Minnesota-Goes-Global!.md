#  Treasure Island Casino in Minnesota Goes Global!

The Treasure Island Casino in Minnesota is making some big changes! The casino, which is located on the shores of Lake Minnetonka, has just announced a new partnership with the global gaming giant Caesars Entertainment.

The partnership will allow Treasure Island to offer its guests access to all of Caesars' properties around the world. That means that if you're a fan of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, you'll soon be able to visit it at Treasure Island.

"We are thrilled to partner with Caesars Entertainment," said CEO A.J. Richie. "This alliance gives our guests unparalleled access to world-class gaming and entertainment offerings."

It's not clear exactly what the partnership will mean for the day-to-day operations of the casino, but officials say that guests can expect "more excitement, more choices and more value."

The news comes as a bit of a surprise, as Treasure Island was recently purchased by another company, Penn National Gaming. It's unclear whether or not the new partnership will have any impact on that transaction.

This isn't the first time that Treasure Island has partnered with a major gaming company. In 2013, it teamed up with MGM Resorts International to offer its guests access to all of MGM's properties around the world.

This includes games like Texas Hold'em, Omaha Hi/Lo, Stud Hi/Lo, Razz, HORSE, and others. In addition, the network offers some of the biggest tournaments in online poker history.

#  Minnesota's Treasure Island Casino Goes Online

Minnesota's Treasure Island Casino announced on Monday that it would be going online in the coming weeks. The casino, which is located on the edge of downtown Minneapolis, will offer its players a range of games, including slots, table games, and poker.

Treasure Island officials say that they are excited to go online and offer their players a new and exciting experience. They note that the casino has been extensively renovated in order to prepare for its online launch, with a new slot floor and a revamped poker room.

Prior to its online launch, Treasure Island had been considering going online for some time. Officials say that the success of other Minnesota casinos in going online played a role in their decision. "We've seen what our neighboring casinos have been able to do with their online offerings and we believe that we can replicate that success here at Treasure Island," said one official.

Treasure Island is not the only casino in the state looking to expand into the online realm. Ameristar Casino recently announced plans to go live in early 2019, while Mystic Lake Casino is already operational.
