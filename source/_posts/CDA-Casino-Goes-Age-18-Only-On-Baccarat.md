#  CDA Casino Goes Age 18-Only On Baccarat

CDA Casino went age 18-only on baccarat starting May 1. The casino operator said the move was in line with the government’s new policy to require people 18 and older to enter casinos.

The change means that guests must be at least 18 years old to participate in baccarat games at the casino, including its VIP room. The minimum age for all other games remains 21.

CDA Casino said the new policy has generated mixed reactions from guests, with some welcoming it and others feeling it is too restrictive.

Baccarat is a card game that usually involves betting on whether a player or banker will get a particular point value on their hand.
