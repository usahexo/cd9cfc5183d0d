<p>If everything looks good and you’re ready to start playing, here’s how you go about using your credit card at an online casino:</p>
<p>First, choose the game you want to play and select its corresponding denomination. Then hit the “credit” button and type in the amount of money you want to wager. Be sure to include any applicable taxes in this amount. Finally, hit enter and your bet will be placed.</p>
<p>If at any time you want to change or cancel your bet, just hit the “credit” button again and make the appropriate adjustments. When you’re ready to leave the table, simply click on “cash out” and follow the instructions from there.</p>
<p>Using a credit card at an online casino is a fairly simple process and should cause no problems provided you take the time to familiarize yourself with the particulars involved. Just remember to keep track of any fees your credit card company may charge and have fun!</p>
