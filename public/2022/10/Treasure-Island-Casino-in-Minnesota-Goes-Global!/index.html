      <h1 id="Treasure-Island-Casino-in-Minnesota-Goes-Global"><a href="#Treasure-Island-Casino-in-Minnesota-Goes-Global" class="headerlink" title="Treasure Island Casino in Minnesota Goes Global!"></a>Treasure Island Casino in Minnesota Goes Global!</h1><p>The Treasure Island Casino in Minnesota is making some big changes! The casino, which is located on the shores of Lake Minnetonka, has just announced a new partnership with the global gaming giant Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>The partnership will allow Treasure Island to offer its guests access to all of Caesars’ properties around the world. That means that if you’re a fan of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, you’ll soon be able to visit it at Treasure Island.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with Caesars Entertainment,” said CEO A.J. Richie. “This alliance gives our guests unparalleled access to world-class gaming and entertainment offerings.”</p>
<p>It’s not clear exactly what the partnership will mean for the day-to-day operations of the casino, but officials say that guests can expect “more excitement, more choices and more value.”</p>
<p>The news comes as a bit of a surprise, as Treasure Island was recently purchased by another company, Penn National Gaming. It’s unclear whether or not the new partnership will have any impact on that transaction.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Treasure Island has partnered with a major gaming company. In 2013, it teamed up with MGM Resorts International to offer its guests access to all of MGM’s properties around the world.</p>
<h1 id="Global-Poker-Signs-Agreement-with-Treasure-Island-Casino-in-Minnesota"><a href="#Global-Poker-Signs-Agreement-with-Treasure-Island-Casino-in-Minnesota" class="headerlink" title="Global Poker Signs Agreement with Treasure Island Casino in Minnesota"></a>Global Poker Signs Agreement with Treasure Island Casino in Minnesota</h1><p>Global Poker, the leading global online poker site, has announced a partnership with the Treasure Island Casino in Minnesota.

<p>With this new agreement, Global Poker players in Minnesota can now enjoy the same great experience and excitement that they have come to expect from Global Poker at one of the top casinos in the state.</p>
<p>“We are excited to team up with such a prestigious casino as Treasure Island and to offer our players an even better gaming experience,” said Jeremiah Fitzpatrick, President of Global Poker. “This partnership reinforces our commitment to providing our players with the best possible gaming experience available anywhere online.”</p>

<h1 id="Minnesota’s-Treasure-Island-Casino-Goes-Online"><a href="#Minnesota’s-Treasure-Island-Casino-Goes-Online" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota’s Treasure Island Casino Goes Online"></a>Minnesota’s Treasure Island Casino Goes Online</h1><p>Minnesota’s Treasure Island Casino announced on Monday that it would be going online in the coming weeks. The casino, which is located on the edge of downtown Minneapolis, will offer its players a range of games, including slots, table games, and poker.</p>
<p>Treasure Island officials say that they are excited to go online and offer their players a new and exciting experience. They note that the casino has been extensively renovated in order to prepare for its online launch, with a new slot floor and a revamped poker room.</p>
<p>Prior to its online launch, Treasure Island had been considering going online for some time. Officials say that the success of other Minnesota casinos in going online played a role in their decision. “We’ve seen what our neighboring casinos have been able to do with their online offerings and we believe that we can replicate that success here at Treasure Island,” said one official.</p>
<p>Treasure Island is not the only casino in the state looking to expand into the online realm. Ameristar Casino recently announced plans to go live in early 2019, while Mystic Lake Casino is already operational.</p>
