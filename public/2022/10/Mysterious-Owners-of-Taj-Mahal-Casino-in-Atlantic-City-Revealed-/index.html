<p>The casino is owned by a company called Resorts Development Group, which is controlled by Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor and chairman of Icahn Enterprises.</p>
<p>Icahn purchased the casino from bankruptcy in March for $360 million. He plans to invest an additional $100 million into the property to revive it as a top gaming destination.</p>
<p>Taj Mahal was one of four Atlantic City casinos to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year. The other three casinos are currently owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation.</p>
<h1 id="The-intrigue-of-casino-ownership-–Who-are-the-mysterious-owners-of-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino"><a href="#The-intrigue-of-casino-ownership-–Who-are-the-mysterious-owners-of-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The intrigue of casino ownership –Who are the mysterious owners of the Taj Mahal Casino?"></a>The intrigue of casino ownership –Who are the mysterious owners of the Taj Mahal Casino?</h1><p>The Taj Mahal Casino, which is located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, is one of the most well-known and luxurious casinos in the world. However, the identity of its owner or owners has been a mystery for many years.</p>
<p>There have been many theories about who owns the Taj Mahal Casino. Some people believe that it is owned by an Indian businessman named Ratan Tata. Others believe that it is owned by a group of Indian billionaires known as the Ambanis. However, these theories have never been confirmed.</p>
<p>In 2008, there was a report in the Wall Street Journal which claimed that the casino was owned by a man named Robert DeNiro. However, this report was later debunked.</p>
<p>In 2016, there was another report in the Wall Street Journal which claimed that the casino was owned by a man named Steve Wynn. However, this report was also debunked.</p>
<p>So, who really owns the Taj Mahal Casino? The answer to this question remains a mystery.</p>
<h1 id="Mystery-continues-to-surround-the-ownership-of-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Atlantic-City"><a href="#Mystery-continues-to-surround-the-ownership-of-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Atlantic-City" class="headerlink" title="Mystery continues to surround the ownership of the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City"></a>Mystery continues to surround the ownership of the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City</h1><p>Since it’s opening in 1990, the Taj Mahal Casino has been shrouded in mystery. There are many unanswered questions about who actually owns the casino and who is responsible for its operations. This week, new allegations have surfaced that suggest the casino may be linked to organized crime.</p>
<p>The investigation into the casino’s ownership dates back to 2015, when federal agents raided the offices of the casino’s owner, Carl Icahn. At the time, Icahn was being investigated for his involvement in an alleged scheme to manipulate the stock of a biofuels company. However, investigators also seized documents from Icahn’s offices that suggested he may have ties to organized crime.</p>
<p>Specifically, prosecutors seized communications between Icahn and several individuals with known ties to organized crime. These individuals included Anthony DeSanzo, a reputed member of the Genovese crime family, and Joseph Benedetto, a reputed member of the Gambino crime family. While it’s still unclear what role these individuals may have played in the casino’s ownership or operations, their connection to organized crime is certainly cause for concern.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with The New York Times, DeSanzo denied any involvement in the casino and insisted that he had only met Icahn once. However, he did admit that he had been contacted by federal investigators about his relationship with Icahn. “They asked me if I ever met him,” DeSanzo said. “I told them I met him once at a horse race.”</p>
<p>Benedetto has also denied any connection to the Taj Mahal Casino and has insisted that he is just a business consultant who has been hired by several casinos in Atlantic City. However, investigators have reportedly obtained telephone records showing that Benedetto called the Taj Mahal Casino more than 150 times between 2012 and 2014.</p>
<p>So far, Icahn has not been charged with any crime and has denied any wrongdoing. He has also refused to comment on his alleged ties to organized crime. However, if these allegations are proven to be true, it could spell trouble for the Taj Mahal Casino and its owners.</p>
<h1 id="Who-owns-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Atlantic-City"><a href="#Who-owns-the-Taj-Mahal-Casino-in-Atlantic-City" class="headerlink" title="Who owns the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City?"></a>Who owns the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City?</h1><p>The Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City is currently owned by the Hard Rock International hotel chain. It is one of the most popular casinos in Atlantic City, and it is known for its luxurious amenities and services. The casino was originally opened in 1990, and it was purchased by Hard Rock in 2017.</p>
<h1 id="Investigation-launched-to-determine-ownership-of-Taj-Mahal-Casino"><a href="#Investigation-launched-to-determine-ownership-of-Taj-Mahal-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Investigation launched to determine ownership of Taj Mahal Casino"></a>Investigation launched to determine ownership of Taj Mahal Casino</h1><p>Authorities in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh have announced an investigation to determine who the rightful owner of the Taj Mahal Casino is. The casino was shut down by authorities last week, who claimed that it was being run without proper licensing.</p>
<p>The casino’s closure has sparked a dispute between two rival groups, both of whom claim to be the legitimate owners of the property. One group is led by local businessman Pankaj Bansal, while the other is headed by Rajendra Mishra, a member of Uttar Pradesh’s legislative assembly.</p>
<p>Bansal’s group claims that they purchased the casino from Mishra in 2014. However, Mishra has denied selling the property and insists that he is still the rightful owner.</p>
<p>“I have all the legal documents to prove my ownership of the Taj Mahal Casino,” said Mishra. “I am prepared to fight this battle in court.”</p>
<p>The authorities have so far been unable to determine who is the rightful owner of the casino. They have ordered both groups to submit evidence to support their claims.</p>
